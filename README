A space shooter. IN SPACE.

You will need LÃ–VE (http://love2d.org/) to play this thing.

For players: this isn't even close to beta. So no detailed guide on how to play this. Sorry.

Most of the programming and artwork is made by Robin Wellner, also known as gvx.
The spaceships that don't look shitty have been made by Mark Sanders, also known as CyaNox.
CyaNox also made the asseteditor, which converts .SVG files to Lua tables.

This game has no license yet, but will probably be GPL or something MIT-style, depending on my mood.
